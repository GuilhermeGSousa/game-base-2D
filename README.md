![](https://github.com/GuilhermeGSousa/game-base-2D/blob/master/main_menu.gif)

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/GuilhermeGSousa/game-base-2D/wiki) for more info on how to use everything in this repo!

## About
A base structure for 2D games using Godot 4.

It aims to include everything needed to create a polished 2D game, from movement scripts to screen postprocessing shaders, while leveraging the new features of Godot 4 and using a clean, scalable and extensible code architecture.

## Install :computer:
This repo uses Godot 4.1 and above!

Simply fork this repo and start working on your game! Some sample scenes are available under `scenes/samples`.

## Itch.io Integration :robot:
This repo also contains workflows to automatically publish this game on itch.io, every time a commit is pushed to `master`. [Check out this wiki page](https://github.com/GuilhermeGSousa/game-base-2D/wiki/Itch.io-Integration) to learn how to set this up for your own game!

- Post processing shaders, including blur, chromatic aberration, CRT effect and vignette
- Shaders for in game effects, such as color flickering, color replace, 2D shake and outlines

### Camera :movie_camera:
